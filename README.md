# Pear Node Server
This is the server which connects to pear-ember, which we use to send mails etc

### 1. Clone the repo

### 2. Run the server
	
	$ node pear-node

### DONE!

### Credentials Management
We do not store our sensitive information on git. Rather copy it from a local store.
I recommend storing your credentials in ~/Credentials/Pear-node/

	$ cp -r ~/Credentials/Pear-node/ ./credentials
